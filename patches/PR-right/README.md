# 'right' patches
For now, these have to be 'copied' and not 'patched' because 
we have to mark 'right' files as binary (and not ISO8859-1) because they
have some funny characters in them.
Once this gets fixed, we can start to patch them.
For now, we have to do a copy of the files over the 'right' files after
taggint all the 'right' files as ISO8859-1
